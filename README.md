# Python100DaysOfCode
In this repo, I share some scripts and notebooks mainly related to finance but random too.

## Day1
I've learned how to (i) set git and github in my computer, (ii) make commits, edit code; and (iii) also how to collaborate in a team developing project.

## Day2
+ Pulled down a couple of repos (Python related) from GitHub with Git Bush
+ Set properly VSCode with Py plugins
+ Set properly VS2019 with C++ build tools to run #PyPortfolioOpt
+ Updated my readme log

My expected plan is following the next journey in learning *Python*:

+ Pandas: Data loading and manipulation
+ Numpy: Vector operations, mathematical, scientific functions
+ Matplotlib + Seaborn + Plotly:  Visualización y gráficas
+ SciPy + Scikit-Learn: stats and classic ML algorithms
+ Tensorflow: Machine learging
+ Keras: Neurals Network
