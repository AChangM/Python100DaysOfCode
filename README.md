# Python100DaysOfCode
In this repo, I share some scripts and notebooks mainly related to finance but random too.

## Day1
I've learned how to (i) set git and github in my computer, (ii) make commits, edit code; and (iii) also how to collaborate in a team developing project.

## Day2
+ Pulled down a couple of repos (Python related) from GitHub with Git Bush
+ Set properly VSCode with Py plugins
+ Set properly VS2019 with C++ build tools to run #PyPortfolioOpt
+ Updated my readme log

My expected plan is following the next journey in learning *Python*:

+ Pandas: Data loading and manipulation
+ Numpy: Vector operations, mathematical, scientific functions
+ Matplotlib + Seaborn + Plotly:  Visualización y gráficas
+ SciPy + Scikit-Learn: stats and classic ML algorithms
+ Tensorflow: Machine learging
+ Keras: Neurals Network

## Day3
Out of topic. I coded a little program in C# that interacts with Ms Excel, using the reference "http://Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel"
It didn't run but It will.

## Day4
I worked with a the Day3 file and I finally got to run the C# code. It was a simple application about registration of sales and vendors.

## Day5
I started with the Python Journey. 
Following the suggestion of working in real-world problems, I started with a small app of webscrapping with #Requests and #BeautifulSoup.
The main task was download 96 files from an academic website.

## Day6
I needed to create a script to allow sending customized emails in terms of body and attachments in a matter of one click. 
To do so, I used the libraries: #Smtlib, #Pandas and #Email.mime.

## Day7
I took the book "Foundations for Analytics with Python" (Brownley, 2016) as a guidance.
Started with the "Python basics building blocks":
- Strings
- Regular expressions and pattern matching
- Dates
- Lists

## Day8
Following with the "Python basics building blocks":
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Control flow
